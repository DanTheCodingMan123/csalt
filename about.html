              <p>
                Founded in Fall 2024, CSalt is a registered student organization at Cornell University, working under the guidance of Professor Maha Haji, and her Ph.D. students in the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Our team is developing a wave-powered desalination system, with plans to compete in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Marine Energy Collegiate Competition (MECC) held every May in Portland, Oregon.

                  The MECC is hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy every May in Portland, OR.
                  The competition is split into four required contests: <br>
                  <br>
                   <strong>1. Business Plan Challenge</strong> <br>Identify a promising market within the blue economy and determine, within that market, the best marine energy application to address. <br>
                   <strong>2. Technical Design Challenge</strong> <br>Evaluate the performance requirements in our chosen blue economy market by identifying and interviewing at least three potential end users. Complete a detailed design of a marine-energy-powered device to serve those end users. <br>
                   <strong>3. Build & Test Challenge</strong> <br>Build a scaled prototype of our concept and perform a series of lab tests. <br>
                   <strong>4. Community Connections Challenge</strong> <br>Foster connections with the broader marine energy industry and the local community. <br>

          <div class="subteam">
            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>
              We believe clean water should be accessible to all, yet pollution and costly extraction often create barriers. Our student-led team is developing a wave-powered desalination system to make water extraction more sustainable and affordable.

            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subteam">
            <h3>Innovation</h3>
            <p>
              We embrace creative problem-solving and cutting-edge technology to design a scalable solution for global water scarcity, constantly seeking new ways to improve and challenge conventional methods.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subteam">
            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>
              We aim to educate the Cornell and Ithaca communities about sustainability and water access challenges, empowering individuals to make a positive impact through outreach and collaboration.

      In 1868, Ezra Cornell wrote, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." More than 150 years later, the "... any person ... any study" principle continues to guide the university community. Cornell welcomes students, faculty, and staff with diverse backgrounds from across the globe to pursue world-class education and career opportunities.
