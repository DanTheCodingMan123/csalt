              <p>
                  CSalt is a student-led initiative at Cornell University, focused on
                  advancing eco-friendly desalination systems powered by ocean wave
                  energy. By combining engineering innovation with environmental
                  responsibility, we aim to develop sustainable solutions for global
                  water challenges. Our team, working closely with Professor Maha Haji
                  and her research group, is designing a wave-powered desalination
                  system to compete in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Marine Energy
                  Collegiate Competition. Join us as we explore the future of wave
                  energy and green technology.

        In 1868, Ezra Cornell wrote, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." More than 150 years later, the "... any person ... any study" principle continues to guide the university community. Cornell welcomes students, faculty, and staff with diverse backgrounds from across the globe to pursue world-class education and career opportunities.
